Our application allows Users to create a profile Displaying GamerTags, Social media Links and even ranks for games. We also have a multitude of different FPS games based on what the Gamer wants to play. After selecting a game there is a blog post like feature that allows the user to leave custom posts that can include how many people they are looking for.
